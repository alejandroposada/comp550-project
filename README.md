potential papers:

+ [Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349)
+ [Automatic Rule Extraction from Long Short Term Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02540)
    + we could combine the outputs of this with the boostrapping idea from class to improve something
